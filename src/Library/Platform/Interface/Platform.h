/**
 * Platform abstraction layer.
 *
 * Platform classes can be broadly divided into three categories:
 * - API handles. These classes don't hold any state and cannot be subclassed in user code.
 * - Extension points. These classes can hold state and can be subclassed in user code.
 * - Value types.
 *
 * API handles exposed by the platform are:
 * - `Platform`, which also works as a factory for other API handles.
 * - `PlatformWindow`, an API handle for a GUI window.
 * - `PlatformEventLoop`, an API handle for running an event loop.
 * - `PlatformOpenGLContext`, an API handle for accessing OpenGL API for a window.
 *
 * Then there are the following extension points:
 * - `PlatformEventHandler`, which should be subclassed in user code to handle platform events. An instance is passed
 *   to `PlatformEventLoop` methods, so this is where the calls back into the user code happen.
 *
 * That's it, there is only one extension point. If you want fancy event handler chains, you can
 * use `FilteringEventHandler`.
 *
 * And then there are value types:
 * - All kinds of enums for keyboard keys, mouse keys, and modifiers.
 * - `PlatformEvent` and subclasses for delivering events to `PlatformEventHandler`.
 *
 * All platform classes don't throw but write errors to log instead. See per-method docs for details on how errors
 * are reported by each method.
 *
 * Also platform declares its own `main` function, so you cannot declare `main` in your code. Platform expects you
 * to define `platformMain` instead.
 *
 * Some guidelines on adding new functionality to platform classes:
 * - If something can be done at the next abstraction layer, then it *should* be done at the next abstraction layer.
 *   Don't clutter platform API.
 * - Platform API should be reasonably minimal, and methods should be orthogonal. You can think of orthogonality in
 *   terms of information content, "is this method returning bits that can also be accessed through another method?"
 *   E.g. compare `position` + `setPosition` + `framePosition` + `setFramePosition` for a window class, vs `position` +
 *   `setPosition` + `frameMargins`. The latter set of methods is orthogonal, the former is not.
 * - The points above mean that platform API handles shouldn't expose non-virtual methods.
 * - Platform API should be getter/setter symmetric as long as the underlying OS API is symmetric. E.g. in the example
 *   above there is no `SetFrameMargins` method because this is not how window frames work.
 * - Platform API handles shouldn't hold state. Don't expose APIs that take ownership of user-allocated data, and don't
 *   cache values returned by the OS (if needed, caching should be implemented at the next abstraction layer). Again,
 *   you can think about this in terms of information content, "platform API handle doesn't expose any bits of state
 *   through its API that cannot be accessed through the underlying OS API".
