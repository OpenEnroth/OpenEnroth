     * For example, it is possible to target 60fps, but since the platform API is in milliseconds, this will result in
     * staggered frame times, with every 1st and 2nd frame taking 17ms, and every 3rd one taking 16ms. This might
     * result in some non-determinism down the line, e.g. changing the code in level loading will change the number
     * of frames it takes to load a level, and this will shift the timing sequence for the actual game frames after
     * the level is loaded. Unlikely to really affect anything, but we'd rather not find out.
