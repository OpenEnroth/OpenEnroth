/**
 * This component exposes a coroutine-like API that makes it possible to control the game by passing in synthetic
 * platform events.
 *
 * The implementation just uses a separate thread that runs a control routine, and the execution can switch between
 * threads from inside the `swapBuffers` call. This effectively means that the control routine runs in between game
 * frames.
 *
 * If the control component is destroyed while the control routine is still running, the control routine will be
 * terminated by throwing an exception from inside `EngineController`. If you use `catch(...)` inside the control
 * routine then this won't work (e.g. google test does this).
