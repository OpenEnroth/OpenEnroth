We are creating an extensible engine & modding environment that would make it possible to play original Might&Magic VI-VIII games on modern platforms with improved graphics and quality-of-life features expected of modern titles, and make modding and installing & playing the mods a pleasurable experience.

Currently only MM7 is playable. You can check out the [milestones](https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth/milestones) to see where we're at.

Download
-------

To download the code without having to compile it we have our releases at [https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth/releases](https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth/releases) 

Note: Currently there are only the nightly builds which may have bugs.

Getting Started on Windows
--------------------------

1. You will need a GoG or any other version of Might and Magic VII. Just run the installer and install the game into default location.

2. Build OpenEnroth as described in [HACKING.md](HACKING.md). Alternatively, you can use the prebuilt releases.

3. Copy OpenEnroth-specific resources from the `resources` folder of the repo to the folder where the game was installed:

    `xcopy "resources\shaders" "C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\Games\Might and Magic 7"`

   Or just use your mouse like a good Windows user.

4. It is recommended to set `OPENENROTH_MM7_PATH` env variable to point to the game installation folder. OpenEnroth might work by reading the paths from registry, but this is not guaranteed.

5. Run the freshly built `OpenEnroth.exe` binary. If you forget to copy content of `resources` subfolder, or if `OPENENROTH_MM7_PATH` points into the wrong folder, you will see errors in the console.


Getting Started on Linux or Mac
-------------------------------

1. You will need a GoG or any other version of Might and Magic VII. If you have an offline GoG installer, then follow these steps:
   * Install `innoextract`. If you're on Ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install innoextract` should work. If you're on Mac then you'll need homebrew, and `brew install innoextract` should do the job.
   * Run `innoextract -e -d <target-folder> <mm7-gog-folder>/setup_mm_7.exe`, where `<target-folder>` is the folder where you want to have game data extracted from the mm7 installer.
   * Check the files in `<target-folder>`, it should now contain the `app` subfolder. This is where game assets were extracted into.

2. Build OpenEnroth as described in [HACKING.md](HACKING.md).

3. Copy OpenEnroth-specific resources from the `resources` folder of the repo to the folder where the game assets were extracted to:

    `cp -rv resources/shaders <target-folder>/app`

4. Set `OPENENROTH_MM7_PATH` env variable to point to the location of the game assets. You might also want to add the following line to your bash profile (e.g. `~/.profile` on Ubuntu or `~/.zshrc` on Mac):

    `export OPENENROTH_MM7_PATH="<target-folder>/app"`

5. Run the freshly built `OpenEnroth` binary.
